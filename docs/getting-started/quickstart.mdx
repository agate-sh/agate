## Your First Agate Application

Let's build a simple Agate application to get you familiar with the framework.

### Step 1: Initialize a New Project

Create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir my-agate-app
cd my-agate-app
go mod init my-agate-app
```

### Step 2: Create Your Main Application

Create a `main.go` file:

```go main.go
package main

import (
    "log"
    "github.com/agate-sh/agate/pkg/app"
)

func main() {
    // Initialize Agate application
    agateApp := app.New()

    // Configure your application
    agateApp.SetTitle("My First Agate App")

    // Start the application
    if err := agateApp.Run(); err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Run Your Application

```bash
go run main.go
```

Congratulations! You've created your first Agate application.

## Adding Agents

Agents are the core building blocks of Agate applications. Let's add a simple agent:

```go
// Add to your main.go
agent := &MyAgent{
    name: "hello-agent",
}

agateApp.RegisterAgent(agent)
```

## Key Concepts

  <Accordion title="Agents">
    Agents are modular components that handle specific functionality in your application.
    They can be interactive, run background tasks, or provide specific services.

  <Accordion title="Shell Integration">
    Agate provides built-in shell management for running commands and managing
    terminal sessions within your application.
